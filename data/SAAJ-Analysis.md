# Approach
My approach towards Lukso audit contest was first going overview of the code provided in order to understand the fundamentals of the project. Then I study previous audit and their recommendation in context of areas that still might have some room for improvement.
Then i start looking for optimisation for enhancing efficiency to reduce overall gas consumption for the project during deployment and afterwards.
In area of findings high or medium risk issues, i started going through codebase more deeply and going through every comment to find any discrepancy which results in successfully finding one medium issue.

# Learning

My learning by involving in this project is to look the code base from different angle to identify areas that may have potential weakness and may cause loss of funds for user or project.

# Comments
My findings for this project is related to front running of initialize function that may be used by attacker to take over the contract and cause damage to project.
