## Approach taken in evaluating the codebase
- Started with the docs
- Then the codes in scope line by line
- I looked briefly at other contracts not in scope
- Later came Back to the docs to counter some notes I made while going through codebase
- Discussed a few ideas with some wardens to hear their view on design choice for better understanding of the project.
- Finally then back to the codebase to sum up my reports/findings
  NB: Instead of writing my reports all on the last day, I prefer to work on them throughtout the project, incrementally. This approach allows me to gain a deeper understanding of the project over time. On the final day, I can then revise and edit certain reports, finalize others, or leave them as they are, depending on the specific requirements and circumstances at hand.


## Anything that you learned from evaluating the codebase
- As a newbie in security smart contract auditing, though I have done lots of researches and practices, this is my very first usage of codebase in a live contest. So, yeah I have learnt a lot evaluating the codebase such as:
- a bit about ERC725
- LSPs and their various implementations
- similarities between the Token standards on LUKSO
- came across some potential vulnerabilities while working on the project that later turned out to be an oversight after proper investigation.
- while working on this project, I realised the huge importance of being a part of the discord community
- finally, though I still have a lot to learn, I finally made an official submition of findings. A feeling I can't express with words.


## Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings
I believe I approached the contest first as a learning opportunity and then submit issues I believe should be looked on, I spent around 40 - 48 hours spread around 5 days on the contest, had over a day break inbetween, and being relatively new to audit contests (~ 1 week), I might have wrongly specified the severity of an issue, but I'm sure you would fix that, and in all these I would be waiting for the comments on my findings to find out what I can improve in my reports or why my thought process is wrong.
Finally, appreciate you and C4 for giving new auditors the opportunity to learn, improve as auditors and earn at the same time it's a feeling I cannot express with words. Thank you!
