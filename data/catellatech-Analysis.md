# LUKSO Analysis by catellatech

## Codebase Analysis (What's unique? What utilizes existing patterns?)
The codebase presents the implementation of several standards such as ERC725, LSP (Lukso Standards Proposal), ERC165, and others. It utilizes existing patterns such as key-value data storage, function delegation, and signature verification.
What's unique in the codebase are the specific implementations and interactions between different standards and contracts. For example, the combination of ERC725X and ERC725Y in an ERC725 contract allows for a more comprehensive set of functionalities. Additionally, the use of LSP1 (Universal Receiver Delegate) provides flexibility for smart contracts to handle and react to specific calls.

## Architecture feedback
The architecture is based on the combination of multiple standards and smart contracts to provide extensive and extensible functionality. This modularity allows for logic updates without altering the code of the main contract. This provides flexibility and facilitates the development and maintenance of this complex system, as changes or improvements can be made independently in each module without affecting others.

## Centralization risks
The use of smart contracts and standards like ERC725 can mitigate some centralization risks by allowing for decentralized ownership and control of accounts and assets. However, it is important to consider other aspects of the architecture and specific implementations to assess potential centralization risks, such as access and permissions granted by the KeyManager contract. However, for us, this is not a problem with the contract itself but rather extends to how each user wants to dispose of it.

## Systemic risks
Systemic risks may be related to the interaction and dependence on multiple contracts and standards. It is crucial to ensure compatibility and proper implementation of interfaces to avoid conflicts and interoperability issues. Additionally, the security implications and possible vulnerabilities in the used contracts and standards should be considered.

## Other recommendations
    - Conduct thorough security reviews and testing before production implementation.
    - Perform interoperability testing to ensure seamless integration of contracts and standards.

## New insights and learnings from the audit
We found it innovative what the Lukso team is doing and the improvements they bring to the web3 ecosystem. We think it was a very complex project, but we liked the proposals they bring to the developer community with the LSPs. We hope that these standards are adopted by developers.
In general, the primary methodology used is manual auditing. The entire in-scope code has been deeply looked at and considered from different adversarial perspectives. Any additional dependencies on external code have also been reviewed.

## Time spent
The time spent analyzing and gaining a deep understanding of what the team behind the project is trying to implement was 3 days.
