# The approach taken in evaluating the codebase

read docs and code alternatives multiple times and after that run tests work on tests.

# Architecture recommendations

It's really awesome, but it will be more gas efficient.

# Codebase quality analysis

docs in the code base and layout of files and folders is great but docs on-site don't cover everything and it can be improved.
There was a wrong description for adding and changing extensions, which solve after a discussion with Yamen.

# Systemic risks

I don't find any risk

I have to add that the LUKSO team is really great, they respond so completely and quickly.
